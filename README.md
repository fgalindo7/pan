# 🐐 Pan — the monorepo shepherd (son of Hermes)

**Pan** is an opinionated, interactive CLI that:

- refuses pushing main/master
- enforces branch naming: `${USER}/{ci,docs,feat,fix,perf,refactor,style}/${MESSAGE}`
- always rebases from origin/master (fallback origin/main) before push
- builds only the Yarn workspaces that changed and runs the relevant test suites
- auto-remediates build failures (cache clean, migrations, Prisma, Docker, user scripts)
- adds/commits/pushes only when the index is clean and logs every step verbosely
- stashes dirty worktrees before rebasing and restores them safely afterwards

## 🏛️ Why “Pan”?

In Greek mythology, **Pan** is the **son of Hermes** (messenger god). Pan is a **shepherd** who brings order to scattered flocks and a musician who creates **harmony** from many pipes. Your monorepo is a wild landscape; Pan guides it from **panic** to push—shepherding packages, harmonizing builds and checks, and safely delivering (pushing) changes.

## 🧰 Installation

### 🛠️ Summary

| Platform | Install Command |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Local clone | `npm install && npm run build && npm link` |
| macOS | `brew tap pan-cli/pan && brew install pan` |
| Debian / Ubuntu | `sudo apt install ./pan_*.deb` |
| Fedora / RHEL | `sudo rpm -i pan-*.rpm` |
| Windows | `npm install && npm run build && npm link` |

### 1. Install (from source)

```sh
npm i -g pan
```

### 2. Local installation (development or direct clone)

If you cloned this repo directly and want to run **Pan** locally:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build the TypeScript source
npm run build

# 3. Link Pan globally so you can call `pan` anywhere
npm link
```

You can now run Pan globally:

```bash
pan --version
pan diagnose
pan push
```

To undo the global link later:

```bash
npm unlink -g pan
```

Or run it without linking:

```bash
# run directly from source
npx tsx src/cli.ts push
# or use the built binary
./bin/pan diagnose
```

---

### 🍎 3. macOS (Homebrew Tap)

Homebrew tap is live:

```bash
brew tap pan-cli/pan
brew install pan
```

To upgrade later:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade pan
```

wget https://github.com/pan-cli/pan/releases/latest/download/pan_0.1.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./pan_0.1.0_amd64.deb
```

#### Fedora / RHEL / Amazon Linux (.rpm)

```bash
wget https://github.com/pan-cli/pan/releases/latest/download/pan-0.1.0.x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -i pan-0.1.0.x86_64.rpm
```

#### Verify

```bash
pan --version
pan diagnose
```

### 🤕 5. Windows

Windows users can clone and run using Node.js:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/pan-cli/pan.git
cd pan
npm install
npm run build
npm link
pan diagnose
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```sh
pan push       # full policy flow: branch → rebase → fix → checks → commit → push
pan diagnose   # quick checks (build/typecheck/lint) with a summarized failure report
pan fix        # smart remediation for build
pan prepush    # lint --fix, type-check, targeted tests, dirty-index-check
pan chat       # contextual LLM session; Pan runs suggested commands with you in loop
pan toolkit    # show alias catalog and quick installers (init/install)
pan help       # detailed usage guide and environment knobs

Add `--verbose` to `diagnose`, `fix`, `prepush`, or `push` to stream command errors inline as they occur.
```

Set the environment variable `PAN_DOCKER_DEV_CMD` to a custom remediation command if your monorepo relies on starting local Docker services during the build (optional).

Pan inspects `yarn workspaces list`, `git status`, and package.json scripts to determine which builds/tests to run. When a build fails, Pan tries the best repair scripts it can find (e.g., `yarn cache clean`, `npx prisma generate`, workspace `migrate`/`fix:*` scripts) before retrying targeted builds.

### 🧰 Toolkit aliases

Pan ships a handful of remediation shortcuts (for example `ycc` → `yarn cache clean` and `yi` → `yarn install`).

- Preferred: `pan toolkit install` — appends the alias block to your shell profile (Pan detects `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc`; override with `--profile`).
- Quick session: run `eval "$(pan toolkit init)"` in your terminal to enable aliases immediately.
- `pan toolkit` prints the alias catalog and reminds you of both setup options.

All remediation commands now live in a single registry (`src/lib/commands.ts`), so the same aliases power `pan fix`, `pan push`, the toolkit output, and the recorded command log. Updating the registry automatically updates every flow.

## 🧠 Optional AI Integration

Set the environment variable `LLM_COMMAND` to any shell command that reads a prompt from STDIN and prints a text suggestion.  
Examples:

```bash
export LLM_COMMAND="ollama run llama3"
# or
export LLM_COMMAND="lmstudio generate --model 'MyLocalModel'"
```

### 🆘 LLM Escalation (last resort)

When every automated remediation fails, Pan opens a terminal chat with ChatGPT (`gpt-5-codex`) or a local LLM, automatically runs any commands it suggests, and reports the outcome back into the same conversation. You can jump in at any point to add clarifications or stop the loop.

- `PAN_CHATGPT_ENABLED` (default: `1`): set to `0` to disable the escalation entirely.
- `PAN_OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`: supply your ChatGPT account key so the session uses your history and permissions.
- `PAN_CHATGPT_CONFIRM` (default: `1`): set to `0` to skip the initial confirmation prompt.
- `PAN_CHATGPT_MODEL` (default: `gpt-5-codex`): override the model if you prefer a different variant.
- `PAN_CHATGPT_BASE_URL` (default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`): point to a proxy or Azure OpenAI endpoint.
- `PAN_CHATGPT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PAN_CHATGPT_MAX_TOKENS`, and `PAN_CHATGPT_MAX_ROUNDS` control request/runtime limits.
- `PAN_ASSISTANT_MODE` can be set to `openai` (default) or `local` to use a shell-accessible LLM command instead of ChatGPT; configure `PAN_LOCAL_LLM_COMMAND`, `PAN_LLM_COMMAND`, or `LLM_COMMAND` (e.g., `ollama run llama3`).

Pan prints the shared log paths and echoes the chat transcript (`[pan]`, `[chatgpt]`, `[you]`) so you can monitor or intervene before the next command runs.

Example (local LLM via Ollama):

```bash
export PAN_ASSISTANT_MODE=local
export PAN_LOCAL_LLM_COMMAND="ollama run llama3"
pan chat
```

If you leave the command blank when prompted, Pan can bootstrap a Docker-based setup automatically (defaults to the `ollama/ollama:latest` image, container name `pan-llama3`, and model `llama3`). Ensure Docker is running and you have permission to pull images before selecting the auto-setup option.

> Note: When using ChatGPT, Pan relies on OpenAI's authenticated API. There is currently no supported browser-login handoff or device-auth flow for external CLIs, so an API key (or compatible proxy token) is required unless you switch to `PAN_ASSISTANT_MODE=local` with a shell-accessible LLM command.
